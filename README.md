Hi!
This is upgraded Tik Tak Toe game, where every field of big board is simple Tik Tak Toe game.
Every move on small board makes impact on where next player can move. For example, if player
moved in right bottom corner of the subboard, then next player is restricted to make his move in right bottom board.
If it is impossible to make move in restricted board (board is full) next player can chose any board he pleases.

Game can be run both in pve and pvp mode.

For now it is only possible to play with another user in the same subnet.
